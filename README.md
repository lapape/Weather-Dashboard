# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this site is to display the current and 5 day weather forecast for the desired city. The user can easily key in a new city, or select a previously searched city from a generated list. This site solves the issue of not being able to quicklly toggle between different cities to display their weather data. I learned how to use third party APIs to fetch data and how to make that data into visual elements on a page.

## Installation

Utalized an update browser to view the site: https://lapape.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

Type a city name into the search bar and click the search button. Current and 5 day weather data is displayed to the right. The searched city is then added under the search button. Click a previously searched city to display the weather data for that city again.
